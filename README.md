## What is CUBIC FC?
CUBIC FC stands for "CU Boulder Integrated Computer Flight Controller" - essentially, the on-board computer for any flight altimetry data. This system will (hopefully) include GPS, BP charge ignition, wireless altimetry reporting, data storage, and more. Features are currently in the works, and as this is an in-development project,
certain features may be omitted or added to the project in the future.
